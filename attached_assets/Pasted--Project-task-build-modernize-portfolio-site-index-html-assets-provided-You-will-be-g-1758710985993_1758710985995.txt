**Project task — build & modernize portfolio site (index.html + assets provided):**

You will be given `index.html` and the `images/` and `icons/` folders.  
Do the following exactly as described below.

---

## 1) Top-level goals
1. Produce a modern, Apple-inspired portfolio page: minimal, generous whitespace, crisp typography, large hero imagery, subtle micro-interactions.  
2. Keep all textual content, external links (GitHub, LinkedIn, CV links, etc.), and the structure (Home, About, Education, Projects, Experience, Skills, Recruiter message, Contact). Do not remove or rewrite my copy.  
3. Optimize assets, accessibility, and responsiveness — mobile first.

## 2) Design & UX rules
- White / near-white cards on a premium **neural-network inspired background** (details below).  
- Crisp typography: system UI font stack `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Arial, sans-serif`.  
- Large, bold headings (hero H1 large, e.g. 48–64px desktop).  
- Minimal top nav: brand on left, simple links on right, sticky with blur.  
- Sections should feel Apple-style: clean, elegant, premium.

## 3) Premium background update
Replace plain white body background with a **professional neural-network inspired theme**:

- Apply a faint, very subtle neural node / network overlay pattern (opacity ~0.03–0.06) or a noise texture for premium depth.  
- Use semi-transparent cards with glass effect: `backdrop-filter: blur(6px);` and `rgba(255,255,255,0.03)`.  
- Provide light-mode alternative respecting `prefers-color-scheme`.  
- Typography remains high-contrast, buttons use `--accent` with soft glow on hover.
